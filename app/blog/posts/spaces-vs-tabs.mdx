    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">My Fumindo – Internal Company System</h1>
    <div className="mt-3 text-gray-600">
      My Fumindo is an internal web-based system used by Fumindo, a fumigation and pest control service company, to manage operations, jobs, finance, and employee productivity in one integrated platform.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div className="border rounded-xl p-6 bg-gray-50 space-y-3">
    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Project Overview</h2>
    <div>
      Fumindo previously relied heavily on spreadsheets and Google Drive to manage daily operations. This caused data duplication, slow reporting, and difficulty in monitoring business performance.
    </div>
    <div>
      The director wanted to build an all-in-one internal system that integrates multiple tools such as Accurate (accounting), Mekari Qontak, and Talenta (HR attendance system).
    </div>
    <div>
      My Fumindo was built to centralize all operational data and provide real-time dashboards for management and operational teams.
    </div>

    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">My Role</h2>
    <div>
      I worked as a Fullstack Developer and also acted as a bridge between users (admins, warehouse staff, field officers, and sales team) and the technical team.
    </div>
    <div>
      My main responsibility was to build and maintain the internal system, work closely with users, and fix operational problems as soon as they appeared.
    </div>
    <div className="italic text-gray-600">
      In short: building and maintaining the internal website, working closely with users, and fixing problems immediately.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div className="border rounded-xl p-6 bg-gray-50 space-y-3">
    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">What I Built</h2>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">

  <div className="border rounded-xl p-6 space-y-3">
    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">System Integration & Features</h2>
    <div>
      We integrated Accurate to extract operational data such as sales orders, delivery orders, and job data. This data is synchronized into the My Fumindo system and used to build internal dashboards.
    </div>
    <div>
      Using this data, we built:
    </div>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
      <li>Job monitoring dashboard (delayed, ongoing, completed jobs)</li>
      <li>Revenue calculation and reporting system</li>
      <li>Productivity dashboard showing which jobs each field officer handled and how much revenue they generated</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
      All of this data can be monitored by the director and super admins, with strict role-based access control to ensure sensitive financial data is only visible to authorized users.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div className="border rounded-xl p-6 bg-gray-50 space-y-3">
    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Impact</h2>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
